# Initial Setup

Loading the tidyverse package for scatterplot + moderndive package to
access the penguins dataset

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

# Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The penguins dataset has **358 rows** and **15 columns**. One important
variable that stands out in this dataset is the **temperature** variable
(i.e., `temp`), along with time of the hour (i.e., `time_hour`) and the
wind speed (ie., `wind_speed`), which are critical in
regulating/influencing temperature levels. It is important to note that
the average temperature has a mean of **39.5821229** in Fahrenheit.
