# Initial Setup

Loading the tidyverse package for scatterplot + moderndive package to
access the penguins dataset.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

# Problem 1

#### Description of Dataset

We will now access the penguins dataset and provide a short description
of the data using inline R code.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The penguins dataset has **358 rows** and **15 columns**. One important
variable that stands out in this dataset is the **temperature** variable
(i.e., `temp`), along with hour (i.e., `hour`) and the wind speed (i.e.,
`wind_speed`), which are critical in regulating/influencing temperature
levels. It is important to note that the average temperature has a mean
of **39.5821229** in Fahrenheit. Moreover, the average hour is
**11.5307263** and the average wind speed is **8.2258269**.

Here’s a list of the remaining variables in the dataset:

- `origin`
- `year`
- `month`
- `hour`
- `day`
- `dewp`
- `humid`
- `wind_dir`
- `wind_gust`
- `precip`
- `pressure`
- `visib`
- `time_hour`

#### Dataframe for Scatterplot

``` r
weather_df =
  early_january_weather |>
  select(time_hour, temp, humid
  )
```

#### Plotting Scatterplot

We will now plot the variables `temp` and `time_hour` to see how the
temperature changed by the hour.

``` r
ggplot(
  weather_df, aes
       (x = time_hour, 
        y = temp, 
        color = humid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Hour of the Day", 
    y = "Temperature (°F)", 
    color = "Humidity (%)") +
  ggtitle("Temperature by Hour") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.25))
```
