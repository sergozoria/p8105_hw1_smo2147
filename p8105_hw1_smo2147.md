# Initial Setup

Loading the tidyverse package for scatterplot + moderndive package to
access the penguins dataset.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

# Problem 1

#### Description of Dataset

We will now access the penguins dataset and provide a short description
of the data using inline R code.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The penguins dataset has **358 rows** and **15 columns**. One important
variable that stands out in this dataset is the **temperature** variable
(i.e., `temp`), along with time of the hour (i.e., `time_hour`) and the
wind speed (ie., `wind_speed`), which are critical in
regulating/influencing temperature levels. It is important to note that
the average temperature has a mean of **39.5821229** in Fahrenheit.

Here’s a list of the remaining variables in the dataset:

- `origin`
- `year`
- `month`
- `hour`
- `day`
- `dewp`
- `humid`
- `wind_dir`
- `wind_gust`
- `precip`
- `pressure`
- `visib`

#### Dataframe for Scatterplot

``` r
weather_df =
  tibble(time_hour = early_january_weather$time_hour, temp = early_january_weather$temp, humid = early_january_weather$humid)
```

#### Plotting Scatterplot

We will now plot the variables `temp` and `time_hour` to see how the
temperature changed by the hour.

``` r
ggplot(weather_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Month & Time", y = "Temperature (Fahrenheit)", color = "Humidity (%)")
```
